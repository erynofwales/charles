Eye/Primary rays: from camera into scene
Shadow rays: rays from surface intersection point toward light source
Reflection rays: from surface intersection point in mirror direction
Transmission rays: from surface intersection point in refracted direction

Algorithm:
    - Send ray from camera through each pixel into scene
    - Compute point of closest intersection with scene object
    - Shade that point by computing shadow rays
    - Spawn reflection and refraction/transmission rays and recurse

When do we stop tracing?
    - When the ray leaves the scene
    - When the ray's contribution becomes too small
